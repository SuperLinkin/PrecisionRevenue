Update the UI and layout of my PRA (Precision Revenue Automation) web app.

Background & Theming:

Replace the current full white background that appears after the hero/first section with a soft gradient or subtle light-themed background that blends well with the top section.

Ensure the background has smooth transitions between sections and maintains high readability.

Keep it modern and tech-finance savvy — avoid stark white, aim for a soft lavender/blue blend.

Update REMY Section:

Remove "Time Saved" stat — replace it with a "Compliance Confidence" metric or "Audit-Ready Score".

Change layout so it looks cleaner and more structured, possibly with an icon or metric badge for REMY’s accuracy.

Maintain REMY’s tone as an AI Revenue Agent — highlight IFRS/ASC mapping, audit automation, and disclosure generation.

Replace Existing Feature Sections:
Remove current sections:

“Advanced Contract Analysis”

“Predictive Revenue Modeling”

“Adaptive Financial Intelligence”

Replace them with a 3-part interactive module showcase:

A. CLAUS (Legal AI Agent):

Add an interactive screen mockup (or component) showing how users can drag and drop legal SaaS clause blocks to generate or review a contract.

Optionally show before/after clause redlines and AI suggestions.

B. MOCA (Modeling & Forecasting AI):

Display a scenario builder where users can set inputs (e.g., churn %, new deals, billing terms) and view a live revenue/cash projection.

Should feel like a modern financial sandbox.

C. DEAL DESK:

Visual showing sales/revenue deals at different stages (Negotiation, Closed-Won, Approval Pending).

Add filters like Region, ARR, Clause Risk Score.

Final Section Fix:

The section labeled "Advanced Financial Intelligence" and the text below it is currently unreadable and blended into the background.

Update background to improve contrast.

Change font color for that text block to a darker shade or apply a light glassmorphism effect to make it pop while keeping the design clean.
