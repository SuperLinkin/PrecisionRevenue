Update the UI and layout of my PRA (Precision Revenue Automation) web app.

1. 🔧 Background & Theming:
- Replace the current full white background that appears after the hero/first section with a **soft gradient or subtle light-themed background** that blends well with the top section.
- Ensure the background has smooth transitions between sections and maintains high readability.
- Keep it modern and tech-finance savvy — avoid stark white, aim for a soft lavender/blue blend.

2. 🎯 Update REMY Section:
- Remove "Time Saved" stat — replace it with a **"Compliance Confidence" metric** or **"Audit-Ready Score"**
- Change layout so it looks **cleaner and more structured**, possibly with an icon or metric badge for REMY’s accuracy
- Maintain REMY’s tone as an AI Revenue Agent — highlight IFRS/ASC mapping, audit automation, and disclosure generation

3. 🧠 Replace Existing Feature Sections:
Remove current sections:
- “Advanced Contract Analysis”
- “Predictive Revenue Modeling”
- “Adaptive Financial Intelligence”

Replace them with a **3-part interactive module showcase**:
---
**A. CLAUS (Legal AI Agent)**  
- Add an interactive screen mockup (or component) showing how users can **drag and drop legal SaaS clause blocks** to generate or review a contract  
- Optionally show before/after clause redlines, AI suggestions

**B. MOCA (Modeling & Forecasting AI)**  
- Display a scenario builder where users can set inputs (e.g., churn %, new deals, billing terms) and view a live revenue/cash projection  
- Should feel like a modern financial sandbox

**C. DEAL DESK**  
- Visual showing sales/revenue deals at different stages (Negotiation, Closed-Won, Approval Pending)  
- Add filters like Region, ARR, Clause Risk Score

4. 🧾 Final Section Fix:
- The section labeled "Advanced Financial Intelligence" and the text below it is **currently unreadable and blended into the background**
- Update background to improve contrast
- Change font color for that text block to a darker shade or apply a light glassmorphism effect to make it pop while keeping the design clean

Apply these changes while maintaining responsive layout, TailwindCSS styling, and keeping everything visually cohesive across the full site.
